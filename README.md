# Customer-Segregation using K-Means Clustering Algorithm

## How to run this project on your desktop?
1. Clone this github repository (code-> copy link-> git clone [link] in terminal)
2. Open a notebook which supports .ipynb files (Google collaboratory, Kaggle, Jupyter Notebook)
3. Run the notebook from the beginning import all the libraries and we are good to go!!
